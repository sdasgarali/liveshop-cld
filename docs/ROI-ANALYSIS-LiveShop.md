## 8. ROI Calculations

### 8.1 Simple ROI

```
Simple ROI = (Total Revenue - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100

Year 1:  ($2,250,000 - $3,528,470) / $3,528,470 = -36.2%
Year 2:  ($7,500,000 - $4,187,350) / $4,187,350 = +79.1%
Year 3:  ($15,000,000 - $4,093,400) / $4,093,400 = +266.4%

3-Year:  ($24,750,000 - $12,847,399) / $12,847,399 = +92.6%
```

### 8.2 Net Present Value (NPV)

Using 15% discount rate (typical for venture investments):

| Year | Net Cash Flow | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 0 | ($1,038,179) | 1.000 | ($1,038,179) |
| 1 | ($1,278,470) | 0.870 | ($1,112,278) |
| 2 | $3,312,650 | 0.756 | $2,504,363 |
| 3 | $10,906,600 | 0.658 | $7,176,543 |
| **NPV** | | | **$7,530,449** |

**NPV is positive ($7.53M)**, indicating the investment creates value above the required return rate.

### 8.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

```
Year 0: -$1,038,179
Year 1: -$1,278,470
Year 2: +$3,312,650
Year 3: +$10,906,600

IRR = 68.4%
```

**IRR of 68.4%** significantly exceeds typical hurdle rates of 15-25%.

### 8.4 Payback Period
